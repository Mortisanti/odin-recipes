# odin-recipes
This is my variation of the "Recipes" project for The Odin Project. Rather than pick out generic recipes from a random website, I chose to base my project on recipes from a YouTube channel called Binging with Babish.

The website consists of a home page with links to three recipe pages. The recipe pages include a steak inspired by The Matrix, a patty melt inspired by Spongebob Squarepants, and a chocolate cake inspired by Matilda.

Credit is given for the images and the recipes themselves, along with links.
