      <h2>Description</h2>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/2017/6/6/chocolate-cake-inspired-by-matilda">Matilda, Danny DeVito's thunderous directorial follow-up to Hoffa (1992), features an inexplicably tempting chocolate cake, despite its open admission of containing bodily fluids. Sit down and consume this entire confection today alongside Dan Pashman of The Sporkful.</blockquote>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 Tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3 cups flour (plus more for dusting)</li>
        <li>3 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 &#189; cups unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp baking powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 &#189; cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>&#189; cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese</li>
        <li>12 ounces butter</li>
        <li>1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 &#189; pound powdered sugar</li>
        <li>&#188; cup milk (optional)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.  Liberally butter three 9” cake pans, and tap a tablespoon of flour around in each, until evenly coated.  Line with a round sheet of parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, first cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, and vegetable oil.  Add the liquid ingredients to the dry, and whisk until smooth.  Divide evenly between the cake pans, and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until a tester comes out clean.  Place pans on racks to cool for at least 30 minutes before flipping onto racks, and allowing to cool completely, another 30-60 minutes.</li>
        <li>While cakes cool, beat together butter and cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer using the paddle attachment.  Once fluffy, add cocoa powder, and mix until combined.  A cup or two at a time, add powdered sugar, and beat until creamy and smooth.  Add a splash of milk if desired to adjust consistency.</li>
        <li>Slice the rounded tops off each layer of the cake, frost, slice, and serve.</li>
      </ol>
